This is a NextJS project intended to serve as a very simple example of Vivid's code generation in a real-world setting. For more information on Vivid's styling philosophy, check out our [docs](https://docs.vivid.lol).

The synced component is [SidebarTab](https://github.com/aryamankha/skiff/tree/main/src/components). 

This example corresponds to [this Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/6k434NG3P8zmZbUdKCHUqX/Skiff?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=sbleukCAmNqQuHOX-1). 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
